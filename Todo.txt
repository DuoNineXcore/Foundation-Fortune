## TODO 
the server crashes when moving money on the extraction event after the 10 second countdown
bots still count towards the chaos target counter
save all perks except ethereal intervention when using it at the player's death, dont save blissful unawareness however.
fix ff_hintopacity only getting the first string of the hint, so like "this is a hint", the opacity command would only affect "this" not the rest
fix sell success hints not displaying as well, along with their audio, nor are they giving any sort of money.
ff_togglehintsystem always disables


## Audio player stuff (FUCK YOU AUDIO PLAYER)
the audio player feature of blissful unawareness nor ethereal intervention do not work, not sure why, might be a music bot issue
play an audio for when a player is within a buying bot or selling bot's radius, something intended a long time ago
fix buy success hints not displaying along with their audio, odd..


## Idk mate
fix newlines with the buy list command
-> I don't see the issue? Might be stupid though

fix the bots not working for players that have their hint system toggled off using ff_togglehintsystem
-> Works for me..? Or am I stupid

perk bottles still display the picked up item thing from exiled even if i clearly turned it off
-> Exiled.CustomItems issues 


## FINISHED:
make an auto downloader that gets audio assets from a github repo so server owners dont have to download the audio files themselves, should be easy enough
-> Done but can be improved a LOT

temporarily remove ff_hintanim
-> Literally just commented it out

ff_addmoney should have saved and on hold options like ff_removemoney
-> uhhhh yes

add a different coroutine for npcs when looking at a player, as of right now, they look at the player using the update hints method. which is slow
-> Done

add "not enough money" response when the player doesnt have enough money when buying, instead of returning the list
add "invalid item" response when the player didnt input anything that matches the perktypes or itemtypes in the buy list 
-> This *mostly* works.. 

add translations for perk bottles 
-> yessss!
